Kajabity Year Chart
===================

A Windows Application to create a printable day-to-day chart for any range of dates from 1 day to 5 years.

Use Kajabity Year Chart to produce a Financial Year planner, Academic Year Planner or any chart for any number of days.  It’s a lot easier than trying to set it all up in a Spreadsheet (I know, I used to do this in Microsoft Excel and got fed up with it).

Features:

* Print a Year Planner for any year or any range of dates up to 5 years.
* Print on any size of paper your printer can print to.
* Includes Print Preview and Page Setup.
* Customise the title and first day of the week.
* Add extra labelled rows or columns to the chart.
* Fully detailed help included.
